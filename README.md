# Launcher

Code::Blocks template for custom launcher executables.

This is a basic Code::Blocks project for creating authentic Windows executables. Includes the resource file that can handle the executable's metadata, such as the icon, the author, the copyright, the language code and so on.

The provided `icon.ico` file is purely demonstrative.
